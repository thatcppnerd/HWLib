# HWLib
Bare Metal Program Library

<!-- This doesn't change, no matter what. -->
HWLib is a library providing wrappers, functions, and utilities for base PC Components to aid in developing bare-metal/freestanding applications.


**WARNING:** This is only meant to be used to create baremetal applications, this won't work on ANY OS.

## What's supported right now?
* ISA Components (PIT, PIC, PS/2 Controller, etc.)
* Legacy VGA
* Parallel ATA/IDE (PIO only, DMA WIP)
